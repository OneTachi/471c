This is a functional programming languages that supports the basic functionality of a compiler by using Load/Store/Branch features. It requires the user to create "Terms" that are discrete, i.e can only be of certain types. The language works literally as an abstract syntax tree where we have a high level understanding of the program at the top node and learn more of what it is composed of the closer we are to the leaves of the tree.
