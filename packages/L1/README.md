L1's language mimics a C like language where the next statement will run after the previous statement runs. It still utilizes an abstract syntax tree like the previous langauge; however, there are some higher level features that have been included. For example, Copy is a higher level feature that moves a value into another skipping the need to load/store in L2. There is also Halt which literally stops the program and returns a value to the user. The language tends to not appear as a tree where one must evaluate the children of a term to continue, but rather must evaluate the next statement.
